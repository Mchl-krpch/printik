# nasm function

##### I didn’t feel well, it seems that I really got “bedы s bash-koi”, so the project dragged on a little, but there is a lot of new in it!

- [x] I switched to Ubuntu-Linux v20.04 OS
- [x] I remembered working with the terminal in Linux
- [x] made simple print function [nasm-lang] 
- [x] learned to call this function from C
